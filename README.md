# Explanatory-Case-Study-Digital-Forensics-Investigation-on-DJI-Spark-Drone
In this explanatory case study, digital forensics methods are used to analyze a DJI Spark drone discovered at a crime scene. The purpose of this inquiry is to obtain vital data that might help with the investigation of drone-related crimes. Drones are now widely used and have grown in popularity in recent years. However, as a result of their greater use, there have been more crimes involving drones. In this explanatory case study, digital forensics methods are used to analyze a DJI Spark drone discovered at a crime scene. The purpose of this inquiry is to obtain vital data that might help with the investigation of drone-related crimes. The drone’s memory card and remote controller, which have flight records, pictures, and videos on them, have important details about the crime and how the drone was used. We gather and examine this material using digital forensics techniques. Investigative personnel will then be able to recognize potential suspects and comprehend
the drone’s participation in the crime. Important details, such as the drone’s flight path, the location of the murder scene, and the identities of the people involved, are revealed by the recovered data. This explanatory case study emphasizes the importance of digital forensics in the analysis of drone-related crimes. Drones will probably be employed more frequently in criminal acts as they become more prevalent in society. Investigators may keep ahead of the curve and efficiently use drones as a source of priceless evidence in criminal investigations by using competent digital forensics techniques.
